  <p>
    I am a PhD student in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Edinburgh, working under the supervision of Prof. Tughrul Arslan. My research focuses on <strong>FPGA-accelerated AI systems</strong>, <strong>hardware acceleration for deep learning</strong>, and <strong>5G communications</strong>, with particular applications in next-generation hearing aids and speech processing.
  </p>
  <p>
    My work specializes in FPGA-based acceleration of neural networks, real-time AI inference optimization, and multimodal signal processing. I am passionate about developing high-performance, energy-efficient hardware accelerators that enable real-time AI processing for hearing-impaired individuals through advanced FPGA implementations and machine learning techniques.
