  <p>
    I am a PhD student in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Edinburgh, working under the supervision of Prof. Tughrul Arslan. My research focuses on <strong>FPGA-accelerated systems for speech processing</strong> and <strong>5G communications</strong>, with particular applications in next-generation hearing aids.
  </p>
  <p>
    My work spans hardware implementation of neural networks, real-time speech enhancement algorithms, and multimodal signal processing. I am passionate about developing energy-efficient and low-latency solutions that can improve the quality of life for hearing-impaired individuals through advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques.
