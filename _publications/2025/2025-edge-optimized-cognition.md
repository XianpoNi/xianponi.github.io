  Traditional hearing aids amplify sound but often neglect critical factors for effective speech comprehension, such as listening effort and dynamic environmental context. This research presents an innovative, edge-optimized, context and cognition-aware speech enhancement framework for next-generation multimodal hearing aids. The proposed framework employs adaptive model selection through a neuro-fuzzy inference engine and dynamically responds to variations in visual quality and listening effort. To ensure low latency and energy-efficient performance on edge devices, the framework integrates lightweight, modular audio and audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) models. Comprehensive evaluation using objective (STOI, PESQ, HASPI) metrics, along with latency and power consumption analysis, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
