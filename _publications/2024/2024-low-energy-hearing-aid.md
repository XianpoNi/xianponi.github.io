  This paper presents a novel approach towards the development of a low-energy, low-latency multimodal hearing aid using a System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGA. The initial prototype integrates two speech enhancement models—audio-only and audio-visual—into the open Master Hearing Aid (openMHA) framework, with processing executed on the embedded CPU of the SoC FPGA. Initial results on speech quality, latency, and power consumption are reported. Future work will focus on hardware acceleration of the machine learning models using the programmable logic of the SoC FPGA to further optimize performance.
